		<para>DataCleaner contains a feature where you can reuse a job for
			multiple datastores or just multiple columns in the same datastore.
			We call this feature 'template jobs'.</para>
		<para>When opening a job you are presented with a file chooser. When
			you select a job file a panel will appear, containing some
			information about the job as well as available actions:</para>
		<mediaobject>
			<imageobject>
				<imagedata fileref="template_job_01_filechooser.jpg"
					format="JPG" />
			</imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
		<para>If you click the 'Open as template' button you will be presented
			with a dialog where you can map the job's original columns to a new
			set of columns:</para>
		<mediaobject>
			<imageobject>
				<imagedata fileref="template_job_02_mapping.jpg" format="JPG" />
			</imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
		<para>First you need to specify the datastore to use. On the left side
			you see the name of the original datastore, but the job is not
			restricted to use only this datastore. Select a datastore from the
			list and the fields below for the columns will become active.</para>
		<para>Then you need to map individual columns. If you have two
			datastore that have the same column names, you can click the "Map
			automatically" button and they will be automatically assigned.
			Otherwise you need to map the columns from the new datastore's
			availabel columns.</para>
		<para>Finally your job may contain 'Job-level variables'. These are
			configurable properties of the job that you might also want to fill
			out.</para>
		<para>Once these 2-3 steps have been completed, click the "Open job"
			button, and DataCleaner will be ready for executing the job on a new
			set of columns!</para>
