		<title>Multi-tenant layout</title>
		<para>The DataCleaner repository layout, used by the monitoring web
			application, is built to support multi-tenant deployments. Therefore,
			on the root level of the repository, folders are located which each
			represent a tenant's separate home folder. Users from one tenant are
			not able to access files or folders from other tenant's home folders.
		</para>

	<section id="tenant_home_layout">
		<title>Tenant home layout</title>
		<para>To function properly, each tenant home folder requires these
			files and folders:
		</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>conf.xml (file)</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>jobs (folder)</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>results (folder)</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>timelines (folder)</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>
			The
			<emphasis>conf.xml</emphasis>
			file represents the DataCleaner configuration for the particular
			tenant. The file format is the same as described in the
			<link linkend="chapter_configuration_file">Configuration file</link>
			chapter. It is recommended to use the supplied example conf.xml file
			(for the 'DC' tenant) as a template for further customization.
			Specifically the custom elements for task-runner, descriptor-provider
			and storage-provider in this template conf.xml file is recommended
			for optimal performance.
		</para>
		<para>
			The folders are all
			<emphasis>managed</emphasis>
			by the DataCleaner monitoring web application, so only in rare cases
			should you manually interact with them.
		</para>
		<para>It is allowed to add more files and folders to the tenant home.
			These will not be managed by the monitor application, but can be
			referenced eg. as the filename paths of datastores defined in
			conf.xml.
		</para>

	<section id="repository_adding_job">
		<title>Adding a new job to the repository</title>

		<para>There are multiple ways to add a new job to the repository. The
			most fail-safe way is to use one of the job wizards, provided by the
			DataCleaner monitoring web application. These are found on the
			'Scheduling' page, using the "New job" button.
		</para>

		</mediaobject>

		<para>
			Alternatively, you can create the job using the desktop application.
			In that case, make sure that the
			<emphasis>name of any involved datastore in the desktop application
				matches the name of the datastore in the repository!
			</emphasis>
			If so, you can safely drop the .analysis.xml job file in the
			<emphasis>jobs</emphasis>
			folder on the repository. It will be immediately available in the web
			UI of the monitor application.
