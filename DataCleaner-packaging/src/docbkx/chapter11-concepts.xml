		<title>What is Data Quality (DQ)?</title>
		<para>Data Quality (DQ) is a concept and a business term covering the
			quality of the data used for a particular purpose. Often times the DQ
			term is applied to the quality of data used in business decisions but
			it may also refer to the quality of data used in research, campaigns,
			processes and more.</para>
		<para>Working with Data Quality typically varies a lot from project to
			project, just as the issues in the quality of data vary a lot.
			Examples of data quality issues include:</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Completeness of data</para>
				<para>Correctness of data</para>
				<para>Duplication of data</para>
				<para>Uniformedness/standardization of data</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>A less technical definition of high-quality data is, that data
			are of high quality "if they are fit for their intended uses in
			operations, decision making and planning" (J. M. Juran).</para>
