		<para>
			The
			<emphasis>Equals</emphasis>
			filter provides a way to make a simple filtering condition based on a
			white list / valid list of values. Simply enter a list of values that
			you accept for a given column, and then you can map your flow to the
			VALID outcome of the filter.
		</para>
		<para>Here's an example of an Equals filter configuration where valid
			Gender values are being checked.

		<para>Use the plus/minus buttons to grow or shrink the list of values
			you want to accept.
		</para>
		<para>If placed as the first component in a flow, the Equals filter is
			optimizable in a way where it will modify your originating query.
			This means that it is also an appropriate filter to use if you just
			want to sample the data used in your job.

		<para>

			from your flow. Additionally you can select whether or not you want
